# DJS04 Project: Book Connect - Web Components

## Introduction

For this assignment, I had to build upon the previous abstractions to refine my skills in creating reusable, encapsulated, and interactive elements. Transforming the Book Preview functionality into a web component is the main goal of this project.

### Project Overview

Encapsulating the book preview feature into a Web Component is the main focus, however we would still need to identify other elements that could benefit from the conversion to being Web Components, and maintain functionality.

#### Tasks

1. Understand the Existing Codebase
2. Create a Web Component for Book Preview
3. Identify and Convert Other Components
4. Testing and Integration
5. Documentation

## Elements Included

**Methods:** Used to render books, create book elements, populate genres and authors, set and update themes, and handle filtering and display of books based on user input.
**Event Listeners:** Used to handle user interactions such as search, settings, and book selection.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

My ability to demonstrate a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles, with the BookStore class encapsulating relevant data and behavior.
This project allowed me to show my proficiency in using JavaScript features such as classes, event listeners, template literals, destructuring, and array methods like slice, forEach, and find.

## Challenges Faced

Handling browser compatibility issues might be a challenge, as different browsers may interpret JavaScript code differently.
Keeping up with frequent updates and evolving standards in JavaScript can be time-consuming and require continuous learning.
Managing asynchronous programming, scoping, and variable hoisting can be tricky and may lead to hard-to-debug issues if not handled properly.

## Overall Learning Experience

Academically speaking, working on this project provides a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming, event handling, and data manipulation in JavaScript..

Personally speaking, this project has been draining, frustrating, and demoralising but absolutely taught me that giving up is not an option when you have a deadline and to just do my best. Since we have only just begun and are barely at the beginning, I know that I'm still going to struggle and this was a great tester for my limits.
